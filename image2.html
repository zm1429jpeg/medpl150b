    I chose this image because, living here, you see nothing but police all over the city. I kind of wanted to illustrate what it feels like to feel the police’s presence crawling down your back, literally visible at just about every block. For both this image and image 1 I played with the path blur tool to give my images a disorienting feel, to provide imagery behind what it feels like to navigate this city. I felt the use of the blur tool here was especially powerful and necessary to show how anxiety-inducing it is to have to see law enforcement as often as we do here.
