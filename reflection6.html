              For this assignment the biggest challenge for me was figuring out how I needed to position the next frame to get the look I wanted. For example, before blinking I knew I wanted my eyes to look like they were facing a distressing situation. I brainstormed what this emotion and circumstance might look like, which resulted in me landing on simply enlarging the eyes and jumping back and forth between the previous frame and the enlarged one. Another challenge when doing the blinking eye was making sure the eyebrows moved correctly so that the right emotion can be expressed. As a result, I had to constantly remind myself to raise the eyebrows up and down along with the eyes, which made the process very time consuming.

              The puppet warp gif however, surprisingly ended up being not that difficult. Looking back though it makes sense considering that when doing a puppet warp you’re not having to draw or make anything from scratch. All of my body parts that I needed to manipulate were already there, so it definitely ended up taking way less time than I originally imagined it would. However, the puppet warp does still have its obvious limitations. The biggest one being that body parts can only be manipulated so much before movements begin looking unnatural, due to us having a flat, non-multidimensional photo to work with. I feel like this made it harder, if anything, to think of what kind of movement I wanted to create since I was so limited in what I could do.
