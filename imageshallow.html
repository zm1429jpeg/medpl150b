  <h1>Shallow Depth of Field</h1>

    I chose this image specifically because it was the moment I decided to give up, but in a way not really. As I was shooting in SoHo I had become so overwhelmed I had no choice but to head towards the subway. Even then though, the colors of the subway and the man in front of me were so striking I couldn’t but take a picture. Being a commuter student this illustrated a scenery all too familiar to me. Having to travel so often, you see nothing but the subway back and forth. To me, this gave imagery to what that felt like. For this one I focused mainly on the cropping to get across my point. I kept the imagery tight, illustrating what it’s like to travel here. That’s why I chose this image for the 1920 x 1080 crop.
