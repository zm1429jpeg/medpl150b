  <h1>Reading 3 – Reflection on Memunatu: ‘Birth in my village’</h1>
            <p>
     For this assignment I read Memunatu’s story “Birth in my village.” First off, I want to say it was a very beautiful story that sheds light on the power of resilience. The use of illustration really helped me to imagine what it was like to be in Memunatu’s shoes. For practical reasons however, I believe illustration was used over photography due to the author not being able to go back in time and re-capture those moments she lived through. For example, I doubt there were pictures taken of Memunatu losing her baby, but even if they were, those are intimate moments that aren’t designed to be shared on the internet. Using illustrations over photographs, in this instance, allows the author to replicate what once was never captured. I do find it interesting though, because a lot of people faced with this dilemma wouldn’t even consider illustrations, and would strictly use text. I appreciated this artistic decision because this is a story that can’t be told correctly just through writing. Additionally, the drawings are able to depict emotions that traditional photography and text can’t, and the creators clearly understood that. Through the drawings provided, we were able to experience the relief and joy Memunatu regained. Including imagery like the multiple hospital beds and greenery in the background truly helped me feel immersed in Memunatu’s world. Given this, I was able to feel that relief and joy right with her.

Finally I believe the advantage illustration has over text and photos is its ability to provide perspective. In photography, you’re very limited with what you can use. Once you wrap up a photoshoot, whatever you shot is whatever you have to work with. If you fail to shoot the shot correctly then a lot of times that means you don’t have a chance to do it again. In this way, you then become limited in the story you’re able to tell. The same goes for using text. In writing, to illustrate anything it requires great detail to be provided. If you fail to be explicit in your imagery the audience is no longer captivated and is taken out of the story. On top of this, not everything can be conveyed through writing. Sometimes there’s no way around using imagery to get your point across. So while both photography and text can be used to provide perspective, illustration is able to do it the best and most efficiently. What cannot be shot on a camera can be easily drawn, the same way what cannot be written can be easily illustrated.

    In conclusion, I thoroughly enjoyed this reading and it has truly left a mark on me. I believe when you live in your own world, it’s hard to imagine the realities that others live in. You truly don’t understand what other people have lived through until it’s right in front of your face. As I mentioned before, this made me really appreciate the illustrations provided. It really helped me actually understand another person’s story on a more personal level.
