    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
    I enjoy exploring all kinds of creativity because they encompass many mediums that allow me to tell a story. However, what I enjoy most is photography and graphic design. Being a black queer woman from the south, I've rarely seen my perspective and life represented in the media. Experiencing this has since inspired me to create thought provoking art through a lens and computer. For me, in order to do this my goal is almost always to express that people who look like me are not a monolith. To capture people like me in their most raw, beautiful, and vulnerable states. And most importantly, to stress the importance of representation in the media.

Being able to do all of these things makes me feel like I’m doing my part in challenging what’s represented in the media. In MEDPL however, I want to broaden what I can do as an artist. For me, my concern has always been how relevant my work will be years to decades, and beyond from now. I want to learn how to dig deeper so that I may create that work that has more depth behind it. I want to create more nuanced work, pieces that will spark up very needed conversation.

      Learning html so far has been pretty hard for me. What I’ve found most difficult is trying to decipher what exactly I did wrong in my code. Maybe I’m just not able to find it right now, but the program seems to not even have a link or anything that’ll lay out what you need to fix. Right now, it all just feels really difficult and frustrating and that alone makes me want to quit and move on to something else honestly. But I am glad that it’s required that we use html because I know it’ll teach me when doing projects to go through a problem, rather than try and find a way around it. Outside of this, I’ve found the coding is pretty easy to get the hang of compared to other programs. Once again, my only gripe is the lack of feedback and help, but I’m sure it’s the same for other programs.

            Since I’ve been doing photography for almost 2 years now, I didn’t really find the editing part to be difficult. However, I’ve always done editorial and conceptual work so I did take this as an opportunity to try something different. Given that I’ve never done street photography before, I took it upon myself to go out into SoHo and try taking pictures of my environment. It was definitely different and so foreign it took forever for me to get adjusted to taking pictures so out in the open. 

            I’ve realized being a street photographer genuinely takes a different level of skill that I hadn’t yet unlocked. What I found to be most difficult is getting used to missing the shot. Shooting on the street is so different because once you’ve missed the shot you’ve missed it forever. It then made it hard trying to get the timing down and making sure everything aligned the way I intended it to. 

            Experiencing this inspired me to edit the pictures the way that I did. I recently moved here from the south, so learning to navigate the city alone is hard enough. You can imagine then, trying to navigate and take pictures at the same time was nothing but disorienting. I used the path blur tool on photoshop to illustrate this. Then I took out the majority of the color in the images to dramatize how gloomy that day was. In my head, I kind of did all of this to illustrate what it’s like to be in a new and completely foreign environment. For me, it was moving to New York and trying street photography for the first time.
