  <h1>Reflection 3 – Depth of Field</h1>
            <p>
           Shooting on dslr, it’s definitely expected that what you shoot in the camera is not going to be what you get on the computer. However, I did forget how noisy pictures get while shooting on a dslr, especially with a higher aperture, due to me having to raise the ISO to combat the lack of light. To fix this, in the camera raw filter I applied a color and regular noise reduction. It caused the picture to have a much clearer look thus allowing me to produce a more clean image. Aside from this, using the camera raw filter was definitely fun. I didn’t realize you could do masks in Photoshop the same way you can in Lightroom. However I did find this frustrating at times since in Photoshop it’s a much less precise and slower process trying to do a mask. Plus I noticed there was no option to mask the background like there is in Lightroom. Working around this was slightly challenging, but I just manually masked out the background using the brush to get past that. 


              Having to use the field blur tool was also very interesting to me. I would’ve never thought to use such a tool for photography. In the past I’ve always used gaussian blurs and path blurs, so this was definitely a new experience. It was cool actually having more control over how you want a blur tool to look and being able to apply it in different ways. All in all, I enjoyed this week's homework. It wasn’t as fun as going into SoHo, but still something I learned something new from so I’m happy about that.
