<body><h2>Susan Sontag, On Photography, Ch. 1 “In Plato’s Cave”</h2>
            <p>
     Being honest, I didn’t really find the reading to be enjoyable or intriguing at all. I felt as if Sontag’s views on photography were actually quite dismissive at times. For example, to say something like photography is not a reflection of reality is to dismiss the fact that photography has the ability to be multidimensional. Photos taken during times of war and civil unrest are images that absolutely cannot be replicated. Even when editing images you still can’t change the actual content that’s been captured. I recently read Amy Azzopardi’s response to this chapter and she seemed to share the same sentiment. “To say that even a photograph of someone smiling portrays nothing of realistic life is not necessarily true…” “Maybe, at the time the photo was taken, the person did feel happy.” Azzopardi, earlier in the article, even gave examples of photographers who do nothing but photograph real life events. Tasks as mundane as doing laundry or watering plants. With this considered, I feel like Sontag’s writing completely dismisses photography’s ability to be a legitimate tool to illustrate real life, or at least emulate it. Especially in today’s time, I feel like we have enough media literacy to be able to differentiate between what is authentic and what’s not. The only way I could see this argument being valid in today’s time is mentioning the rise of AI and its ability to completely erase what is reality. 

     However, I do agree with Sontag’s views on photography’s negative grasp on society. With the rise of digital media Sontag’s perspective on this has only (and unfortunately) aged like fine wine. Sontag mentions how when most are given the option to save a life or snap a photo, many would choose to snap the photo. While I agree that photography has been an instrument of the desensitization of society, it did make me think about the film ‘Civil War.’ In short, the film follows a group of photo journalists who make their way to Washington DC in the midst of a very violent war. I remember the main character, Lee Smith, touching on this subject, stating that she views photo journalism as a necessity in order to warn viewers and ensure the events she captures doesn’t happen again. The younger, aspiring photo journalist even asks Smith if she would take a picture of her if she were to die, in which she replies “Yes.” So even though I do agree with Sontag’s point I do think there is still a rebuttal there. Although it is a very fine line to walk on, I believe that there can be very specific instances that call for the capturing of the explicit nature of an event. 

     I’d even argue that there’s nothing wrong with wanting to capture your vacation or your every move. Personally, there are plenty of times I’ve gone back through my camera roll, with a smile on my face, reliving the moments I now get to keep in my phone for forever. I understand her point, but to me it only poses the question ‘What is then the alternative to this?’ To live in a world with no memories to look back on? So yes, photography does have its negative affect on society, but I feel like its positives outweigh those negatives greatly.
