            Since I’ve been doing photography for almost 2 years now, I didn’t really find the editing part to be difficult. However, I’ve always done editorial and conceptual work so I did take this as an opportunity to try something different. Given that I’ve never done street photography before, I took it upon myself to go out into SoHo and try taking pictures of my environment. It was definitely different and so foreign it took forever for me to get adjusted to taking pictures so out in the open. 

            I’ve realized being a street photographer genuinely takes a different level of skill that I hadn’t yet unlocked. What I found to be most difficult is getting used to missing the shot. Shooting on the street is so different because once you’ve missed the shot you’ve missed it forever. It then made it hard trying to get the timing down and making sure everything aligned the way I intended it to. 

            Experiencing this inspired me to edit the pictures the way that I did. I recently moved here from the south, so learning to navigate the city alone is hard enough. You can imagine then, trying to navigate and take pictures at the same time was nothing but disorienting. I used the path blur tool on photoshop to illustrate this. Then I took out the majority of the color in the images to dramatize how gloomy that day was. In my head, I kind of did all of this to illustrate what it’s like to be in a new and completely foreign environment. For me, it was moving to New York and trying street photography for the first time.
