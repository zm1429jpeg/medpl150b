  <h1>Reflection 4 & 5 â€“ Photomontage and Social Campaign</h1>
            <p>
           When comparing the photomontage and the social campaign homework, the montage one was definitely more challenging. For me, the biggest obstacle was figuring out how to ensure my message was legible through the images I chose. Particularly the one I created about the disenfranchisement of the African American community. I feel like when doing that one I was more passionate about the material I included rather than making sure the imagery was clear and concise. Since we only had to choose one montage for the social campaign homework, this is why I chose the brainwashing one instead. I felt like the disenfranchisement one was so jam packed with a lot of imagery that it would become suffocating after incorporating vectors into the design.

              So when analyzing the brainwashing montage I knew I had a lot more to work with, but it was still going to be a challenge figuring out how to incorporate vectors. This is why I decided to use text in the design as well. I knew what would be easiest is taking the text, manipulating it, and intertwining vectors within the text. In order to do this, I first created outlines on the text so that I could change the positioning and direction of the letters. Next, I took all of the As out and pasted the text into photoshop. Once this was done, I just turned a picture of a star into an editable vector and pasted them onto the design. Finally, I used the color dodge blending mode on the stars to match the grunginess feel of the design.
