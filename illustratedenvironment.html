    For this assignment I chose this landscape because it provided a lot to work with and because the small subject allowed for me to create contrast in the picture. I chose this color palette specifically as well to play with complimentary colors and make it clear which is the foreground, middle ground, and background. Additionally, when doing the background I wanted to incorporate different shades of the orange to illustrate the different layers within it. So basically the darkest orange is meant to illustrate the far background while the bright orange is representative of the background closest to the viewer.
