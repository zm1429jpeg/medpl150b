  <h1>Reading 2 – Reflection on Nesrine Malik, ‘AI slop’</h1>
            <p>
     Reading the “AI Slop” article was really interesting because I felt like it put a lot of vocabulary behind what I’ve been feeling. For example, towards the end Malik comments on how AI contributes to the desensitization of society, sucking us into “subjective worlds” rather than the “objective reality.” Malik then goes on to say this has become “a new way of sleepwalking into disaster.” I resonated with this heavily given that my generation seems to be tapped out, in comparison to past generations when they were my age. We actually talked about this in one of my other classes. We spoke about how traditionally it has been college students that have been politically active who fought for justice. Looking at the young generation today, this doesn’t seem to be the case. More than anything, everyone seems to be numb to the gravity of the situation we’re in. Like when an AI video of Jake Paul doing his makeup surfaced, it was immediately met with laughter rather than critique. Given that our country is rapidly falling into fascism you would think this would raise a lot of concern, and yet every situation like this is instantly dismissed. This, to me, is the “sleepwalking” Malik is referring to. AI and the content we see has now successfully become a way of disarming us due to its overstimulating and perverse nature.

Another point that stood out to me was the politicization of AI. I was sickened to see the generated image of immigration arresting the Dominican woman. The fact that institutions like the White House are even able to post something like that is a call to how necessary regulation is. And yet, I don’t think we’ll see any regulation in the near future because the lack of allows fascists and conservatives to push their political agenda. This poses a threat to everyone, conversative, fascist, or not because it contributes to the deterioration of our infrastructure. If the use of AI continues the way it has, we’re bound to experience a depletion of resources and increased competition for such. Considering the article as well, it all poses the question, "Is it really worth it?” The answer should be no, but I’m sure in 3 years we’ll see nothing but an increase in this politicization of AI.

    All in all, I agreed with Malik completely. AI slop is not worth it, nor should it ever be. I will say though, this article gives me hope knowing that other people feel the same way I do. It also proves just how important it is to be vocal in this time no matter how much society tries to silence you. A conclusion that I’ve gathered is in times like these, critical thinking is integral more than anything. It may be getting harder and harder to differentiate between what’s real and what’s not, but at the same time we can still choose what we engage with and what we don’t. AI only has the impact we allow it to have.
