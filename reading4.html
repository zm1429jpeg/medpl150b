  <h1>Reading 4 – Reflection on The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It</h1>
            <p>
              Looking at The Rising Risk, and How We Stop It, from a digital media perspective, I was very surprised to see the New York Times invest so much in visual media to get their point across. It was very cool having to scroll in order to reveal what was written next, along with the colors and lighting of the webpage changing and you progressed. Witnessing the screen change from black, to red, to orange, then to white gave me anxiety, as if I was in an actual bombing myself. As a result, I was hooked and completely locked into the article that followed. Considering this, the New York Times was definitely successful at getting their audience to genuinely care about nuclear bombings, and the increasing possibility of more happening. Additionally, I felt like their wording in the beginning was very intentional and is what caused me to want even more information after reading.

            One thing in particular I felt the New York Times did best however was the graphics that were included at the end of the article. It was very interesting and captivating to read what a nuclear bomb going off looks like, along with the graphics that illustrated this. I feel like in today’s time society is so desensitized, to the point we struggle to empathize with real life events others go through. On top of this, because we live in a digital age, where information is constantly delivered online, it becomes very easy to compartmentalize, separating what we see online from what we see in real life. Furthermore, our media traditionally illustrates bombs as something that is passing, strictly fictional, or strictly for entertainment. Never in the media do we see the ramifications of bombings explored or what it's like for a community to experience this. For me, I feel like the graphics kind of reminded me that even though I haven’t experienced a nuclear bomb in my own backyard, it is still a very real thing that can affect just about anybody. I really appreciated this because in many ways it served as a reality check.

    All in all, I really enjoyed exploring this reading, and while I felt the actual article itself could’ve used some depth, the visual aids employed by the New York Times really kept me captivated. Especially considering that if I were to ever see this article title scrolling online I would’ve never clicked it. Additionally, upon reading everything I’d argue this type of content should be explored and employed more when trying to appeal to a young audience. I believe what society needs is something eye catching and jarring that gets people engaged, and this is exactly that. I’d even argue as well that if this style of content was used more by established publications we’d see another increase of young adults who seek to be politically active. This then ties into a deeper argument about how essential the arts really have proven to be, and how they can be used to enhance our understanding of current events and history.
