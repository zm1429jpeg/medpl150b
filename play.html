  <h2>Background: Today you’ll be playing as Calypso. You’re a wonderful 7th grader with a bright future ahead of you. All of the staff seems to like you, except one lady…. Ms. Jackall. Being the clumsy person you are, you constantly bump heads. You see, Ms. Jackall has a knack for order, and she absolutely hates anyone that disrupts that… or challenges it.
