    For this assignment I decided to record my data on media and what people's media consumption looks like. Particularly within my generation. The results went pretty much how I predicted but what did surprise me is how many people fell within the "other" category in my first 2 questions. It made me wonder what I missed or didn't consider since I felt I'd been pretty thorough with providing as many answer choices as possible.
